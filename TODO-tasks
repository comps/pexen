- 'manager' class, glue for factory+sched
  - at least one manager - test suite runner (pass/fail/error/etc.)

- sched.GroupSched class - wrapper for multiple chained Sched runs
  - metadata-defined workers/spare
  - should be kinda easy

- sched.Sched premature shutdown (see TODO in .py)

- adding new tasks on the fly
  - task indexing logic inside Pool will need to be redone
  - lifting many implementation limitations
  - Pool.simulate would still be applicable/doable as nothing new is scheduled
    while we're checking the deps
  - .register() function to pre-register callables that might be add_tasks-ed
    (no-op for Thread-based pool)
